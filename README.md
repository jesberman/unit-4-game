Star Wars RPG


Hi, so this is my repository for the Star Wars RPG game.  It's fairly simple to use.  First, select the character you want to play as from among the four options in the "Selecet Your Character" section.  The four choices are: Obiwan Kenobi; Luke Skywalker; Darth Maul; and Darth Sidious.

Once you've chosen your charcter, the game will next ask you to choose which enemy you would like to fight first out of the three remaining characters.  For example: if I choose Luke Skywalker, I will next have to fight against Obiwan, Maul, and Sidious.  

To win, you must defeat all three opponents without being killed yourself.  Note: every time you attack, your attack power will double.  As such, to survice, you should first attack the characters with the lowest attack power.  Once you've built up your character's attack power on the first enemy, the last two should be able to be destroyed with just one or two more hits.

(Hint: Luke and Obiwan have the lowest attack values.  If you want to win, first target Luke, then Obiwan, then Maul, and lastly Sidious).
